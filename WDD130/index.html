  <h2>My name is Kirill Kuptsov</h2>

  </p>
  <p>I am from Russia and was born in the capital city of Moscow.<br>
  I am married and we have two sons aged 14 and 16.</p>
<p>We live in a small apartment. At the same time, we have two black Labradors
 and two Angora cats. They get along well with each other.</p>
<p>My hobbies are computers, traveling to the sea, fishing.</p>
<p>Our family has been in the Church for more than 20 years and we love our parish.<br> Although I must say a lot of transformations have taken place since then.
We still do not have our own church, but for many years the Moscow stake.</p>
<p>I'm glad to be in the same class with you.</p>
